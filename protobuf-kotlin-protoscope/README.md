# protobuf-kotlin-protoscope

This module implements [the Protoscope language](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protoscope), which allows for the
textual representation of the protobuf wire format and is useful for testing purposes.

Protoscope code can be tokenized and converted to its binary representation. Note that the reverse is not currently
supported.
